Welcome to my site! It's currently a work in progress.  
===
My research focuses on advancing Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) through reverse-engineering biological brains.  I believe most of the large improvements in A.I. have come about through this method, from reinforcement learning to Deep Neural Networks.  

I am advised by Yiannis Aloimonos in the Computer Science Department



Non-Academic Pursuits

I am a lover of music, and a cellist for the [UMD Gamer Symphony Orchestra](http://umd.gamersymphony.org/homepage.php).  I also enjoy long walks in the rain, Joseph Joestar, jazz piano, and politics.
